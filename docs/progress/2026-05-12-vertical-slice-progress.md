# AFK4 Current Progress Snapshot

Status: the first MVP-oriented vertical slice is implemented through client
packaging, signed update metadata registration automation, diagnostics, reports,
audit search, and backup/restore runbooks.

Last updated: 2026-05-16

## Purpose

This file is the compact current-state snapshot for new sessions. It replaces
the old long-form progress log, which is archived at:

- `docs/archive/progress/2026-05-12-vertical-slice-progress-history.md`

Use the archive only when historical verification details or phase-by-phase
implementation evidence are needed.

## Implemented Capabilities

### Backend Platform

- ASP.NET Core modular monolith foundation on .NET 10.
- EF Core/Npgsql persistence and migrations for identity, tenancy, devices,
  layout, sessions, billing, POS, shifts, updates, audit, diagnostics, and
  reports.
- Staff sign-in and refresh-token rotation.
- Predefined MVP role-to-permission mapping.
- Branch-scoped authorization for implemented operator-facing endpoints.
- Device enrollment, credential issuance, heartbeat validation, command
  dispatch/status, command result fallback, credential rotation, and revocation.
- Persisted zones, seats, device-seat assignments, floor-map reads, installed
  app reporting, and device detail projections.
- Session start, extend, transfer, end, signed leases, reconciliation, and
  heartbeat-driven lock/unlock/lease-refresh command planning.
- Immutable ledger-backed wallet, debt, packages, refunds, manual corrections,
  tariffs, package definitions, and package consumption.
- POS catalog, stock movements, sales, manual payments, refunds, voids,
  receipts, shifts, cash movements, and shift close reconciliation.
- Update package registration, package/rollout state changes, rollout status
  reads, device update check/status endpoints, and Agent update status tracking.
- Audit search endpoint.
- Branch diagnostics endpoint.
- Operational reports and CSV exports for shifts, sales, gameplay time, cash
  operations, and operator actions.

### Operator App

- WPF + MVVM production-oriented shell.
- Protected token storage abstraction.
- Permission-filtered navigation.
- Realtime floor map loading and selected-seat session actions.
- Player search, wallet/package summaries, POS, shifts, reports, CSV exports,
  settings, technician device tools, update package/rollout management, audit
  search, diagnostics, and production hotkeys.

### Agent Service

- Heartbeat payloads and worker loop.
- Device credential authentication.
- Realtime device hub client.
- Signed session lease validation and persistent lease/runtime state.
- Reconnect reconciliation snapshots.
- Lock/unlock enforcement coordinator through testable adapter boundaries.
- Player Shell process supervision.
- Named-pipe Shell state publishing and Shell launcher command handling.
- Allow/deny process policy foundation.
- Update check/status client and background update execution worker with
  artifact download, SHA-256 verification, ECDSA metadata signature validation,
  persisted recovery state, install/rollback/restart adapter boundaries, and
  status progression.

### Player Shell

- Fullscreen WPF MVVM UI for locked, active-session, warning, grace/offline,
  ending, and launcher states.
- Receives Agent-published state through local named pipes.
- Sends launcher requests back to the Agent for validation.

### Packaging And Updates

- WiX/MSI baseline:
  - Operator App MSI.
  - Coordinated gaming-PC MSI for Agent Service + Player Shell.
- Local package build script:
  - `scripts/build-client-packages.ps1`
- Provider-neutral Authenticode signing script:
  - `scripts/sign-client-packages.ps1`
- MSI update metadata publishing script:
  - `scripts/publish-client-msi-updates.ps1`
- Backend registration script for generated update package request JSON:
  - `scripts/register-update-package-requests.ps1`
- Manual GitHub Actions workflow for build/test/package, optional signing,
  optional metadata publishing, and guarded package registration.
- Cost-aware GitHub Actions workflows:
  - PR verification with branch-protection-safe result job and conditional
    Windows build/test execution.
  - Package smoke for unsigned MSI validation on `main` and manual dispatch.
  - Manual release package workflow with short artifact retention.

### Operations Docs

- Local PostgreSQL smoke runbook.
- Agent installer enrollment runbook.
- Client update rollout runbook.
- Client packaging runbook.
- Update package publishing runbook.
- PostgreSQL backup/restore rehearsal runbook.
- Production readiness roadmap.

## Latest Verification

Final verification after merging PR #9 on 2026-05-16 from `D:\afk4.net`:

```powershell
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' test AFK4.sln --no-restore -p:NuGetAudit=false -p:UseSharedCompilation=false -v minimal
```

Result:

- 624 passed
- 0 failed
- 0 skipped

Additional verification from the Authenticode CI registration slice:

- targeted client release automation tests passed 25/25;
- PowerShell parser checks passed for signing, publishing, and registration
  scripts;
- full solution build succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors;
- package smoke produced both MSI artifacts:
  - `afk4-gaming-pc-0.1.0-ci-internal.msi`
  - `afk4-operator-app-0.1.0-ci-internal.msi`
- `git diff --check` was clean before merge.

CI checks on PR #9 were not configured, so the recorded confidence is local
verification plus PR review, not enforced repository branch protection.

Cost-aware CI configuration verification on 2026-05-17:

- targeted client release automation tests passed locally;
- workflow-content tests cover PR verification, package smoke, and manual
  package workflow cost controls;
- PR #11 remote `PR Verification` passed on GitHub:
  - `Detect Relevant Changes`;
  - `Build And Test Windows`;
  - `PR Verification Result`.

## Known Gaps

- No real staging/prod environment is configured in the repository.
- GitHub Actions workflows are defined and PR #11 remote verification passed,
  but branch protection still needs to require `PR Verification Result` before
  CI becomes a mandatory release gate.
- Staff management workflows, custom roles, and role editing UI are not
  implemented.
- Operator App layout management UI is not implemented.
- Automatic Agent-side consumption of rotated credentials is not implemented.
- Windows lock/unlock enforcement needs real Windows 10/11 device validation
  beyond adapter-level automated tests.
- Production Authenticode certificate authority/storage is undecided.
- Object-store/CDN provider and presigned URL automation are undecided.
- Dedicated service credential policy for update package registration is
  undecided.
- PostgreSQL restore rehearsal has a runbook but still needs a real
  staging/prod-like run before launch.
- Production lease duration and heartbeat refresh threshold need tuning after
  real Agent telemetry.

## Recommended Next Work

1. Create a production-like staging environment for Platform API and PostgreSQL.
2. Enable branch protection for the `PR Verification Result` check after PR #11
   is merged.
3. Run full PostgreSQL/API/Operator/Agent/Player Shell live smoke with a real
   enrolled Windows gaming PC.
4. Rehearse PostgreSQL backup, restore, and migration against staging data.
5. Choose production Authenticode certificate authority/storage, object-store
   or CDN provider, presigned URL automation, and update registration credential
   policy.
6. Harden Agent production behavior: rotated credential consumption,
   reboot/lock recovery, rollback tests, and lease timing telemetry.
7. Implement the minimum admin/configuration workflows needed for a pilot club:
   staff management, role assignment, and layout management.

## Recent Integration Notes

- PR #9, `Add Authenticode CI update registration flow`, merged into `main` on
  2026-05-16 with merge commit
  `6f11e140d9c45b1592f71dc6c3e056fdb272c710`.
- The feature branch `codex/authenticode-ci-registration` was deleted after
  merge.
