# AFK4 Vertical Slice Progress

Status: Phase 2 identity, tenancy, RBAC, and audit backend baseline started on
`codex/phase2-identity-tenancy-rbac-audit`
Last updated: 2026-05-12

## Scope

This document tracks delivery progress and known implementation deviations for
the first technical vertical slice and the realtime device channel follow-up.
It is intentionally separate from `AGENTS.md` because progress changes more
frequently than agent instructions.

Stable product and architecture decisions live in:

- `docs/product/AFK4-MVP-PRD.md`
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-12-afk4-platform-architecture-design.md`

The implementation plans for this slice live in:

- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-12-afk4-platform-vertical-slice.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-12-afk4-realtime-device-channel.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-12-afk4-phase2-identity-tenancy-rbac-audit.md`

## Implemented Foundation

- Repository baseline with `global.json`, `Directory.Build.props`,
  `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, and expanded `README.md`.
- `AFK4.sln` with backend, shared contracts, building blocks, Agent Service,
  Operator App, Player Shell, and tests.
- Strongly typed Guid ID primitives in `AFK4.BuildingBlocks`.
- Shared DTO contracts for device heartbeat and floor map.
- Platform API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/health`
  - `GET /api/branches/{branchId}/floor-map`
  - `POST /api/devices/{deviceId}/heartbeat`
- SignalR hub at `/hubs/devices`.
- Server broadcast event `deviceStatusChanged`.
- Agent Service options, heartbeat payload factory, and HTTP heartbeat worker
  loop.
- WPF Operator App shell with floor map ViewModel.
- WPF Player Shell fullscreen locked-state skeleton.
- Master MVP PRD at `docs/product/AFK4-MVP-PRD.md`.

## Realtime Device Channel

Implemented on branch `feature/realtime-device-channel`:

- Shared realtime contracts and stable event/method names for device
  connection, command dispatch, and command result acknowledgement.
- Backend device hub registration and `POST /api/devices/{deviceId}/commands`
  dispatch endpoint with basic command request validation.
- Agent SignalR client, command acknowledgements, reconnect re-registration,
  and HTTP heartbeat compatibility when realtime startup fails.
- Operator realtime status state path with dispatcher-safe ViewModel updates
  and startup failure handling.

## Device Enrollment, Credentials, And Command Status

Implemented on `main` after the realtime device channel merge:

- Shared contracts for enrollment code creation, device enrollment responses,
  device credential headers, and command status responses.
- Backend in-memory enrollment code flow:
  - `POST /api/branches/{branchId}/device-enrollment-codes`
  - `POST /api/devices/enroll`
- Enrollment-issued device credentials with server-side hashed secret storage.
- Heartbeat credential validation through `X-AFK4-Device-Credential`.
- SignalR device registration credential validation through
  `DeviceConnectionRequest.CredentialSecret`.
- Backend in-memory command status tracking:
  - commands are stored as `Pending` when dispatched;
  - reported command results update the stored status;
  - `GET /api/devices/{deviceId}/commands/{commandId}/status` returns current
    status.
- Agent options and HTTP heartbeat now carry the enrollment-issued device
  credential secret.

## PostgreSQL-Backed Device Persistence

Implemented on `main` after the in-memory device management foundation:

- Added `PlatformDbContext` with EF Core/Npgsql configuration.
- Added initial migration `AddDevicePersistence` for:
  - `devices`
  - `device_credentials`
  - `device_enrollment_codes`
  - `device_commands`
- Replaced runtime device enrollment and credential validation with
  `EfDeviceEnrollmentService`.
- Replaced runtime command status storage with `EfDeviceCommandStore`.
- Replaced heartbeat handling with `DeviceHeartbeatService`, which persists the
  latest device heartbeat state before broadcasting realtime status.
- Added API test host override that uses EF InMemory provider so automated tests
  do not require a local PostgreSQL server.

## Local PostgreSQL Runbook And Smoke

Implemented on `codex/local-postgres-smoke-runbook` after commit `69a7f4c`:

- Added root `compose.yaml` for a localhost-bound PostgreSQL dev database.
- Added `.config/dotnet-tools.json` to pin local `dotnet-ef` at version
  `10.0.4`.
- Added `docs/operations/local-postgres-smoke.md` with commands for:
  - starting PostgreSQL through Docker Compose;
  - restoring the EF CLI tool;
  - applying EF migrations;
  - starting the Platform API;
  - running health, device enrollment, heartbeat, command creation, and command
    status checks.
- Linked the runbook from `README.md`.

## Phase 2 Identity, Tenancy, RBAC, And Audit Baseline

Started on `codex/phase2-identity-tenancy-rbac-audit` after commit `892c3d3`:

- Added a focused implementation plan at
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-12-afk4-phase2-identity-tenancy-rbac-audit.md`.
- Added shared staff sign-in contracts and explicit permission names.
- Added EF Core entities and migration `AddIdentityTenancyAndAudit` for:
  - `organizations`
  - `branches`
  - `staff_users`
  - `staff_role_assignments`
  - `staff_access_tokens`
  - `audit_records`
- Added predefined MVP role-to-permission mapping.
- Added staff sign-in through `POST /api/auth/staff/sign-in` with opaque
  bearer access tokens stored as hashes.
- Added request-time staff context resolution from `Authorization: Bearer`.
- Added branch-scoped authorization for
  `POST /api/branches/{branchId}/device-enrollment-codes`.
- Added audit records for allowed and denied device enrollment-code creation.
- Updated API tests so device enrollment and heartbeat setup use an authorized
  technician before creating enrollment codes.

## Known Deviations And Adaptations

### Solution Format

`dotnet new sln` on the installed .NET 10 SDK defaulted to `.slnx`. The project
requires `AFK4.sln`, so the solution was created with:

```powershell
dotnet new sln -n AFK4 --format sln
```

### Agent HTTP Package

`Microsoft.Extensions.Http` was added to `AFK4.Agent.Service` because the Worker
uses `AddHttpClient` and `IHttpClientFactory`.

### API Error Shape

The heartbeat route/body `DeviceId` mismatch response currently returns an
object with `Error` and message:

```text
Route deviceId must match request DeviceId.
```

The implementation plan used lowercase `error` and a slightly different
message. This is not blocking for the slice because no client depends on the
error contract yet, but it should be normalized before treating API contracts
as stable.

### Device Management Foundation Scope

The current device enrollment, credential, heartbeat state, and command status
implementation now has PostgreSQL-backed runtime persistence through EF Core.
It is still a foundation slice, not the complete production device management
module.

Known limitations:

- enrollment code creation is now protected by staff identity, branch-scoped
  permission checks, and audit;
- device command dispatch and command status endpoints still need staff
  authorization and audit coverage;
- device credential revocation and rotation are not implemented yet;
- Operator App technician workflows for enrollment and status inspection are
  not implemented yet.

### Phase 2 Baseline Scope

The current Phase 2 work is a backend-first baseline. It does not yet include:

- refresh token rotation;
- Operator App protected token storage;
- staff management workflows;
- custom role editing;
- audit search or reports;
- authorization coverage for every existing operator-facing endpoint.

## Latest Verified State

Full verification was run from `D:\afk4.net` on 2026-05-12 after the Phase 2
backend baseline changes:

```powershell
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' build AFK4.sln --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' test AFK4.sln --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
```

Results:

- build succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors;
- tests passed with 53 visible passing tests, 0 failed, 0 skipped.

Targeted TDD verification was also run for:

```powershell
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' test tests/AFK4.Shared.Contracts.Tests/AFK4.Shared.Contracts.Tests.csproj --filter StaffAuthContractSerializationTests --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' test tests/AFK4.Platform.Api.Tests/AFK4.Platform.Api.Tests.csproj --filter AuditRecordWriterTests --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' test tests/AFK4.Platform.Api.Tests/AFK4.Platform.Api.Tests.csproj --filter StaffAuthenticationEndpointTests --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' test tests/AFK4.Platform.Api.Tests/AFK4.Platform.Api.Tests.csproj --filter DeviceEnrollmentAuthorizationTests --no-restore -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
```

Results:

- staff auth contract test passed after the contract RED/GREEN cycle;
- audit writer test passed after the audit persistence RED/GREEN cycle;
- staff sign-in endpoint test passed after the identity RED/GREEN cycle;
- device enrollment authorization tests passed after the RBAC/audit
  RED/GREEN cycle.

The local PostgreSQL live smoke has not yet been rerun after the Phase 2
authorization change. The runbook has been updated so the next smoke seeds a
local technician, signs in, and sends the enrollment-code request with a staff
bearer token.

Local PostgreSQL live smoke was run from `D:\afk4.net` on 2026-05-12 after the
Docker Compose runbook was added:

```powershell
docker compose config
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' tool restore
docker compose up -d postgres
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' ef database update --project src/AFK4.Platform.Api/AFK4.Platform.Api.csproj --startup-project src/AFK4.Platform.Api/AFK4.Platform.Api.csproj
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' run --project src/AFK4.Platform.Api/AFK4.Platform.Api.csproj --urls http://localhost:5074
```

Live smoke results:

- Docker Compose parsed successfully and PostgreSQL healthcheck reached
  `healthy`.
- EF migration `20260512060601_AddDevicePersistence` applied to PostgreSQL.
- PostgreSQL contained `__EFMigrationsHistory`, `devices`,
  `device_credentials`, `device_enrollment_codes`, and `device_commands`.
- `GET /api/health` returned status `ok`.
- `POST /api/branches/{branchId}/device-enrollment-codes` returned enrollment
  code `AFK4-0E77-3FA32297EE7E`.
- `POST /api/devices/enroll` returned device
  `f7f1066b-94b0-4578-be48-75d5512df551` and credential
  `7cf3a039-0c1b-47cf-a824-4deb0e781c8b`.
- Authenticated `POST /api/devices/{deviceId}/heartbeat` returned heartbeat
  interval `10`.
- `POST /api/devices/{deviceId}/commands` created command
  `d5b7c37a-5c01-4668-a9f8-e05f3211d4ec`.
- `GET /api/devices/{deviceId}/commands/{commandId}/status` returned
  `Pending`.
- Direct PostgreSQL reads confirmed the latest smoke device had
  `IsOnline = true`, `IsLocked = true`, and a non-null heartbeat timestamp.
- Direct PostgreSQL reads confirmed the latest smoke command stored
  `Type = lock`, `Status = Pending`, and payload
  `{"reason": "local-postgres-smoke"}`.
- The API process was stopped after smoke verification.
- PostgreSQL was stopped with `docker compose down`; the named volume was kept.

Previous live smoke was run on `http://localhost:5074` for the realtime device
channel:

- `GET /api/health` returned status `ok`;
- `POST /api/devices/d76eff15-9cf9-4c30-a6d4-c05fd215793f/commands`
  returned `DeviceCommandDto` responses for `lock` commands;
- Agent Service was started with the requested organization, branch, device,
  machine, and platform URL environment variables;
- Agent logs showed realtime connection for
  `d76eff15-9cf9-4c30-a6d4-c05fd215793f`;
- after sending another command, Agent logs showed command acknowledgement as
  `Accepted`;
- backend and Agent smoke processes were stopped after verification.

WPF Operator App live smoke was not run in this subagent environment. The
automated Operator App tests are the current proof for the dispatcher-safe
realtime status state path and startup failure handling.
