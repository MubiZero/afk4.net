# Client Packaging Runbook

Status: Phase 13 packaging decision runbook
Last updated: 2026-05-16

## Purpose

This runbook records the approved MVP packaging direction for AFK4 Windows
clients and links the operational package flow to the existing update rollout
system.

Detailed design:

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-14-afk4-client-packaging-design.md`

Implementation plan:

- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-14-afk4-phase13-client-packaging-ci.md`

## Packaging Decision

AFK4 uses WiX-authored MSI packages as the MVP packaging baseline:

- Operator App has its own MSI.
- Agent Service and Player Shell share one coordinated gaming-PC MSI.
- MSIX is deferred as a future optional Operator App distribution channel.

This matches the current runtime model: the Agent is an elevated Windows
Service, the Shell is supervised by the Agent, and updates are centrally
managed through signed package metadata and staged rollout status.

## Update Pipeline Relationship

The existing update pipeline remains authoritative:

1. Build a client artifact.
2. Publish the artifact to file-system hosting or a production object store/CDN.
3. Sign package metadata with `AFK4.Update.Publisher`.
4. Register the generated package metadata in the backend.
5. Validate the package and create internal, beta, or stable rollouts.
6. Agents download, verify, install, report status, and recover through their
   configured install, rollback, and restart adapters.

Phase 13 changes the artifact shape from ad hoc published zip outputs toward
MSI artifacts. It does not change backend rollout authority or Agent signature
verification.

## Agent MSI Adapter Shape

The Agent already supports external update commands through:

- `Agent:UpdateInstallerExecutablePath`
- `Agent:UpdateInstallerArgumentsTemplate`
- `Agent:UpdateRollbackExecutablePath`
- `Agent:UpdateRollbackArgumentsTemplate`
- `Agent:UpdateRestartExecutablePath`
- `Agent:UpdateRestartArgumentsTemplate`

For local MSI experiments, the install command can point directly at
`msiexec.exe` with:

```text
/i "{PackagePath}" /qn /norestart
```

For production, prefer a helper script that wraps `msiexec.exe`, writes update
logs, treats MSI exit code `3010` as successful restart-required behavior, and
keeps Agent restart scheduling outside the currently running Agent process.

## Safety Rules

- Do not commit MSI artifacts.
- Do not commit Authenticode certificates, private keys, ECDSA update signing
  keys, generated package request JSON, or presigned upload URLs.
- Do not ship durable device credentials or enrollment tokens inside an
  installer.
- Register and roll out internal packages before beta or stable packages.
- Test rollback before production Agent rollout.

## Current Commands

Restore repository-local tools before packaging work:

```powershell
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' tool restore
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' wix --version
```

Expected WiX version:

```text
7.0.0
```

WiX v7 requires explicit OSMF EULA acceptance for build and CI usage. The
Phase 13 build script passes `-acceptEula wix7` to each `wix build` invocation
after explicit project approval.

Verify the local package build script parses:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -Command "[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile((Resolve-Path scripts/build-client-packages.ps1), [ref] `$null, [ref] `$null) | Out-Null"
```

Build Windows client package inputs and MSI artifacts:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build-client-packages.ps1 `
  -Version 0.1.0-ci `
  -Channel internal
```

The script writes publish outputs under ignored
`artifacts/client-packages/publish/` and MSI artifacts under ignored
`artifacts/client-packages/`.

Expected MSI artifact names:

```text
afk4-operator-app-<version>-<channel>.msi
afk4-gaming-pc-<version>-<channel>.msi
```

CI uses the same command through the manual GitHub Actions workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/client-packages.yml
```

The workflow restores .NET tools, builds and tests the solution, runs
`scripts/build-client-packages.ps1`, and uploads the generated MSI artifacts.

For older zip-based internal signed update experiments, the existing update
artifact publishing wrapper remains available:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/publish-client-update.ps1 `
  -Component agent-service `
  -ProjectPath src/AFK4.Agent.Service/AFK4.Agent.Service.csproj `
  -Version 1.2.3 `
  -Channel internal `
  -OrganizationId 0c04d6c0-bfa8-4e26-9263-fc0d307d0f08 `
  -HostingRoot C:\afk4-updates `
  -PublicBaseUri https://updates.afk4.test/packages/ `
  -SigningKeyPath C:\afk4-secrets\update-signing-key.pem `
  -ReleaseNotes "Internal Agent Service validation build."
```

Production release jobs can later extend this workflow with Authenticode
signing, object-storage upload, and Update Publisher registration once those
provider choices are explicit.
