# Client Packaging Runbook

Status: Phase 13 packaging decision runbook
Last updated: 2026-05-14

## Purpose

This runbook records the approved MVP packaging direction for AFK4 Windows
clients and links the operational package flow to the existing update rollout
system.

Detailed design:

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-14-afk4-client-packaging-design.md`

Implementation plan:

- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-14-afk4-phase13-client-packaging-ci.md`

## Packaging Decision

AFK4 uses WiX-authored MSI packages as the MVP packaging baseline:

- Operator App has its own MSI.
- Agent Service and Player Shell share one coordinated gaming-PC MSI.
- MSIX is deferred as a future optional Operator App distribution channel.

This matches the current runtime model: the Agent is an elevated Windows
Service, the Shell is supervised by the Agent, and updates are centrally
managed through signed package metadata and staged rollout status.

## Update Pipeline Relationship

The existing update pipeline remains authoritative:

1. Build a client artifact.
2. Publish the artifact to file-system hosting or a production object store/CDN.
3. Sign package metadata with `AFK4.Update.Publisher`.
4. Register the generated package metadata in the backend.
5. Validate the package and create internal, beta, or stable rollouts.
6. Agents download, verify, install, report status, and recover through their
   configured install, rollback, and restart adapters.

Phase 13 changes the artifact shape from ad hoc published zip outputs toward
MSI artifacts. It does not change backend rollout authority or Agent signature
verification.

## Agent MSI Adapter Shape

The Agent already supports external update commands through:

- `Agent:UpdateInstallerExecutablePath`
- `Agent:UpdateInstallerArgumentsTemplate`
- `Agent:UpdateRollbackExecutablePath`
- `Agent:UpdateRollbackArgumentsTemplate`
- `Agent:UpdateRestartExecutablePath`
- `Agent:UpdateRestartArgumentsTemplate`

For local MSI experiments, the install command can point directly at
`msiexec.exe` with:

```text
/i "{PackagePath}" /qn /norestart
```

For production, prefer a helper script that wraps `msiexec.exe`, writes update
logs, treats MSI exit code `3010` as successful restart-required behavior, and
keeps Agent restart scheduling outside the currently running Agent process.

## Safety Rules

- Do not commit MSI artifacts.
- Do not commit Authenticode certificates, private keys, ECDSA update signing
  keys, generated package request JSON, or presigned upload URLs.
- Do not ship durable device credentials or enrollment tokens inside an
  installer.
- Register and roll out internal packages before beta or stable packages.
- Test rollback before production Agent rollout.

## Current Commands

Restore repository-local tools before packaging work:

```powershell
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' tool restore
& 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe' wix --version
```

Expected WiX version:

```text
7.0.0
```

Verify the local package build script parses:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -Command "[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile((Resolve-Path scripts/build-client-packages.ps1), [ref] `$null, [ref] `$null) | Out-Null"
```

Publish Windows client package inputs for the next WiX MSI step:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build-client-packages.ps1 `
  -Version 0.1.0-ci `
  -Channel internal
```

The script writes publish outputs under ignored
`artifacts/client-packages/publish/`.

Until the Phase 13 MSI build scripts are implemented, use the existing update
artifact publishing wrapper for internal signed update experiments:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/publish-client-update.ps1 `
  -Component agent-service `
  -ProjectPath src/AFK4.Agent.Service/AFK4.Agent.Service.csproj `
  -Version 1.2.3 `
  -Channel internal `
  -OrganizationId 0c04d6c0-bfa8-4e26-9263-fc0d307d0f08 `
  -HostingRoot C:\afk4-updates `
  -PublicBaseUri https://updates.afk4.test/packages/ `
  -SigningKeyPath C:\afk4-secrets\update-signing-key.pem `
  -ReleaseNotes "Internal Agent Service validation build."
```

The next Phase 13 implementation steps add WiX MSI authoring and a GitHub
Actions workflow.
